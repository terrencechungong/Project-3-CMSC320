    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: How would you describe the distribution of life expectancy across countries for individual years? Is it skewed, or not? Unimodal or not? Symmetric around it’s center?\n",

    "I would expect the distribution to be skewed in earlier years where some countries may have had relatively low life expectancies. I would expect the skewness to decrease over time. \n",
    "The distribution would be bimodal since some third world countries may have lower life expectancies related to other first world countries. The less developed countries would have mean life expectancies that cluster around lower values then less advanced countries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since life expectancy seems to increase over time, a regression line would capture this relationship. On the violin plot of residuals, we would expect the residuals to be centered around 0 for most years, with more positive residuals appearing in the later years where the mean life expectancy may be underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: According to the assumptions of the linear regression model, what should that violin plot look like? You would answer this question as a general property of the residuals of the linear regression. We are looking to see if the Question 3 model fits the general assumptions.\n",

    "The violin plot should show the values clustering around (peaking points near 0) for each point on the violin plot showing that the error has been minimized as best as possible. We would also expect box plot tails on the top of the box, representing the underestimation of the life expectancies."
